The following values were not passed to `accelerate launch` and had defaults used instead:
	`--num_processes` was set to a value of `1`
	`--num_machines` was set to a value of `1`
	`--mixed_precision` was set to a value of `'no'`
	`--dynamo_backend` was set to a value of `'no'`
To avoid this warning pass in values for each of the problematic parameters or run `accelerate config`.
Detected kernel version 4.18.0, which is below the recommended minimum of 5.5.0; this can cause the process to hang. It is recommended to upgrade the kernel to the minimum version or higher.
